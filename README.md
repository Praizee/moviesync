# MovieSyncðŸŽ¬

## Overview
MovieSync is a web application that allows users to browse movies, bookmark them for later, mark them as favorites, and manage their profiles. Authentication is required for bookmarking, favoriting, and accessing detailed movie information. The app ensures persistence of user data and supports cross-device syncing.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **API:** TMDB API (The Movie Database) for movie data
- **Authentication:** Supabase

## Features
### Movie Browsing (Public)
- All users (authenticated or not) can view a list of movies.
- Only authenticated users can access detailed movie information (e.g., description, trailer).
- Users can search for movies.

### User Authentication
- Implemented via Supabase.
- Once authenticated, users can:
  - Bookmark movies to watch later.
  - Mark movies as favorites.
  - Remove movies from bookmarks and favorites.
  - Access and edit their profile details.
  - Logout securely.

### Dashboard (Authenticated Users Only)
- Displays a list of bookmarked and favorite movies.
- Dynamically updates when movies are added or removed.

### Cross-Device Syncing
- User bookmarks and favorites persist and sync across different devices.

### Movie Details (Authenticated Users Only)
- View in-depth movie details such as descriptions and trailers (if available).

### Profile & Settings
- Users can view and edit their profile (e.g., update their name).
- Profile changes persist across sessions.

### General UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, responsive, and clean user interface.
- Proper error handling for unauthenticated access attempts.
